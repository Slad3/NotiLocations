    <string name="about_desc">How many times have you had a task to do outside of the house, but forgot the next time you were near that location?
        Our app is here to solve that problem. This app introduces a simple way for people to manage errands and tasks that many may forget when out and about in their daily lives.
        Connecting the app to your phoneâ€™s location allows the user to input various tasks or errands that need to be done, such as stopping at the grocery store to pick up a few items,
        or the pharmacy to pick up a prescription. Simply input or select a specified location on the map and input a goal for the location,
        such as a shopping list that will be sent to the user when within the specified radius which can then be opened and viewed. </string>
